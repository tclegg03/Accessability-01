## Description
I was motivated to work on this project webpage to better understand how various components of HTML and CSS operate together. Being able to use the dev tools in real time to make adjustments to different elements helped me to see how items like padding, margins, and postioning effect layout design. Building this webpage gave me more confidence in my ability to use both HTML and CSS.
